            My name is Maja and I'm happy to share with you the outcome of my
            30-day coding challenge. This website is a kind of a gallery,
            summarizing my month of daily coding. I focused mostly on practising
            CSS and JavaScript, but you will also find projects with React and
            Vue. I hope you will enjoy checking my projects!

            <h3>What is the challenge about?</h3>
            <p>
              I started the challenge in January 2024 with the idea that if I start coding in the new year, I will develop a habit of doing it daily. And so it happened! My main goal was to learn the process of creating a new project by heart and to understand more of JavaScript. Initially, I planned and scheduled the concepts I would work on during the first two weeks, but later on, I decided to choose my new challenge in the morning, depending on my mood. Working on this challenge was truly enjoyable because I had a lot of freedom. Most projects were quite quick to finish, as I dedicated one hour daily to them. However, some projects were more advanced, reaching even about 8 hours of development.

            <h3>Tools and inspirations</h3>
            <p>
              During my 30-day coding project I mostly followed tutorials on YouTube, but I also came up with some ideas on my own. For instance, I created projects like 'Button That Runs Away' (Project 9), 'Panic Website' (Project 24), and the 'Calculate Life Path Number' App (Project 27), which I'm especially proud of. Alongside the challenge, I was also taking a course on Scrimba, where I practiced using JavaScript methods. This inspired me to create projects focused on some of those methods.

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
              You might notice that the projects I started with were simpler, but as I continued coding daily, my skills improved. Each day, I challenged myself to push further and create more advanced JavaScript solutions, or I practiced using React or Vue. However, there were times when I just enjoyed experimenting with CSS. I'm really proud of what I've accomplished, and I plan to keep coding every day. My next goal is to revisit some of my earlier projects and make them even better. Some of the most important skills which I brushed up on are: working with API, understanding flexbox, using React Hooks.

            I started coding in November 2022 and I can't believe how much I've
            learnt since then! I'm on my way to become a super skilled coder and
            I can't wait for what the future may bring.
