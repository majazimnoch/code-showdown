# 30-day Coding Challenge showdown!

## Intro
I was coding consequently for 30 days and here I publish all of the projects that I made during this time. Some of them are quite quick and easy, but some required couple of hours of working and were made in days. 
This website is a kind of a gallery and I developed it in simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I made a json file where I placed all information about each project (such as photo, title, comment) and then I fetch this data in my JS file. This solution made my code more tidy and organized.
